 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your freedoms
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you
this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

  For the developers' and authors' protection and ours, the AGPLv3
explicitly states that there is no warranty for this copyrighted
software.

  Also, even if the said software is modified by someone else and
offered to you over a network, this AGPLv3 requires that the modified
source code be made available to you.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws, such as semiconductor
mask work laws, for other kinds of works.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting "modified version" of the work is a work
"based on" the earlier work or "containing the Program".

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
copy. Propagation includes copying, reproduction, rental, lease,
sublicensing, broadcast, communication to the public, and transmission.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not "conveyance".

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

 1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an Executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
window system, etc.) of the specific operating system (if any) on which
the Executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run the work.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files, and
the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form must include
any copyright notices and license notices that are placed in the work's
compatible HTML documentation (or if there is no HTML documentation,
in the file that contains the copyright notices and license notices in
the work) and that refers to this License. You must not remove any such
notices.

 2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without any conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under Article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any effective technological
measures' prohibition of circumvention as to that covered work, and you
disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work
(notwithstanding any other provision of this License).

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
  under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
  requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
  notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
  to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
  therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
  to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
  are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in
  any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
  separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
  need not make them do so.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also meet these conditions:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), or in a public offering
  for download accessible to the public for at least one year, or in
  a public offering for download accessible to the public for as long
  as you offer public access to the Program or a work based on it,
  whichever is longer, or with permission from the FSF.

  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the complete
  Corresponding Source code, which must be distributed under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5 in a medium customarily used for software
  interchange.

  c) If you convey the object code by offering access to copy from a
  designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the Corresponding
  Source from the same place at no further charge. You need not require
  recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
  code. If the place where the Corresponding Source is offered is a
  network server, you may satisfy this requirement by permitting
  (without charge) copying of the Corresponding Source to copy from
  the same place to the same network server, or to a different network
  server designated by you.

  d) You must preserve all the notices of this License and other
  applicable licenses that appear in the Corresponding Source.

 7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as if they were included in this License's Version 3, to the
extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be treated
modulo those additional permissions.

  When you convey a covered work, you may opt to remove any additional
permissions from that work, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain
cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions,
if you like, on material you add to a covered work, provided that you
satisfy the conditions of this License for that material.

  If a "Statement of Additional Permissions" refers to a resource (such
as a URL) that provides an additional permission, that is an "External
Additional Permission". If the information in the Statement of
Additional Permissions is entirely contained in the covered work itself,
it is an "Internal Additional Permission".

  If you add terms to a covered work that are not additional
permissions, you must remove them as soon as you find out that they
violate section 10.

  No other political purpose statements, or any other statements that
claim to modify or interpret this License in any way, will be accepted
as additional permissions.

 8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the first
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by any reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
patent licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not
permanently reinstated, you do not have permission to exercise any of
the rights granted under section 2 of this License.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary to a peer-to-peer transmission
of a copy, your receipt of the object code alone does not require you
to accept this License. However, nothing other than this License grants
you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

 11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. A work
is "contributed" by a particular contributor if it is distributed in
accordance with that license.

  A patent license "from a contributor" is any express grant of patent
rights made by that contributor that covers use, reproduction,
modification, propagation, and conveyance of the contributed work.

  An "essential patent claim" is a patent claim (here other than a
design patent claim) that would, solely by virtue of its inclusion in
the Program, be infringed by making, using, importing, or selling a
covered work, if the Program were run. This does not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
Program, if the Program were not so modified. Unless you are the
originator of this patent claim, if you have patent rights in that
claim, you agree to grant a patent license to the FSF in accordance
with the FSF patent policy (https://www.fsf.org/licensing/patents/patents.html)
throughout the entire period for which you hold copyright on the
Program.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license
from a contributor, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not
available to anyone, for free and under the terms of this License,
through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
means, then you must take reasonable steps to ensure that the
Corresponding Source is available by providing a free network server or
other readily accessible means for at least three years, or until a
successor becomes available, if you cease to maintain the network
server.

  For example, if a patent license is granted only for a specific
country, and you convey the Program to a recipient in another country,
then you must take reasonable steps to ensure that the patent license
covers the patent claims in that country.

  Nothing in this License grants any additional patent license or other
intellectual property protection.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for conveying the Program,
the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the combination as a whole will be governed by the GNU General
Public License version 3, in all other respects.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that proxy servers should be used to protect
privacy, you may use proxy servers in conjunction with the Program or any
work derived from the Program.

  If you wish to distribute and use the software without being subject to
all of the conditions of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may
consult with the Free Software Foundation.

                     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is located.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
      License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does not have interactive user interfaces, you should
add an "about" command or a "license" command or "source" command
to display the "Appropriate Legal Notices" for the program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.
